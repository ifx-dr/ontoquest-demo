In Standard-Batteriegehäusen sind diese Batterien sofort einsatzbereit und 1:1 gegen herkömmliche Blei-, EFB- oder AGM-Batterien austauschbar.\n\nDer extrem geringe Innenwiderstand der LFP-Batterien bewirkt eine einzigartige Hochstromfähigkeit. Hierdurch kann die Lichtmaschine ihres Fahrzeugs die Batterie in kürzerer Zeit mit deutlich höheren Strömen aufladen.\n\nOb Leistungsabgabe, Ausdauer, Schnellladefähigkeit, Gewicht oder Kapazität – eine Accurat Impulse LFP punktet mit vielen technischen Vorzügen, die eine zuverlässige Stromversorgung garantieren.\n\nAccurat Impulse Batterien mit LFP-Technologie überzeugen mit ihrer Leistung, Gewicht – und Sicherheit. Dank ihrer Bauart und dem intelligenten Batterie-Management-System (BMS) sind alle Modelle geschützt vor Überladung, Kurzschluss und Überhitzung. Lithium-Batterien können Sie so überall problemlos verbauen – auch bei Umgebungstemperaturen von über 50 °C. Und dank ihrer geringen Selbstentladung lassen Sie sich ganz einfach lagern – garantiert ohne Gasung.\n\nSource: Accurat (https://www.autobatterienbilliger.de/Accurat-Impulse-I20L3-Lithium-Autobatterie-20Ah-LiFePO4)',0.0,0,0,0,false,false);

INSERT INTO definition_scores VALUES(DEFAULT,'Absorbant_Glass_Mat_Battery','The AGM battery is versatile, powerful and designed for high demands. At its core, the structure of an AGM is no different from that of a wet battery. However, the electrolyte in an AGM is no longer free-floating but bound in a special glass fiber separator - hence the name "absorbent glass mat". The large contact area achieved in this way contributes to the high power output and also makes the battery leak-proof. Due to its design, the battery is hermetically sealed. This special feature enables the internal recombination of oxygen and hydrogen, so that there is no loss of water. To protect against impermissible overpressure, the individual battery cells are equipped with a safety overpressure valve, so that safety is guaranteed even in the event of a fault.\n\nThe AGM battery also has significant advantages over simple starter batteries in terms of service life. An AGM battery can handle three times as many charging cycles as a conventional starter battery. Another advantage of the AGM battery is that it is position-independent, since the material integration of the electrolyte means that no liquid can leak out. Even if the battery housing breaks, no battery acid can leak out.\n\nAn AGM battery is the ideal energy storage system for vehicles with automatic start-stop systems with braking energy recovery (recuperation), since a conventional starter battery cannot meet the high performance requirements of these systems. But the AGM battery is also the right choice for cars that have a high energy demand and a large number of electrical consumers on board.\n\nSource: Varta (https://batteryworld.varta-automotive.com/de-de/batterietypen-sli-efb-agm-unterschiede)',0.0,0,0,0,false,false);
